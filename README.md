# SampleCode
Samples of code written exclusively by myself
As a sample project for what I'm able to do, I've built a UI dashboard in TKinter and imported data from Github (Game of Thrones data) and then transformed the data into a format that is easily visualized. Normally, I would execute SQL commands for gathering, transforming or storing data and add more error handling, however, due to the nature of the proejct, completed as such.
