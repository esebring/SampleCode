# SampleCode
As a sample project for what I'm able to do, I've built a UI dashboard in TKinter and imported data from Github (Game of Thrones data) and then transformed the data into a format that is easily visualized. Normally, I would execute SQL commands for gathering, transforming or storing data and add more error handling, however, due to the nature of the project, completed as such. 

This program will work on any computer with an internet connection. The objective of the program is to visualize data points from the Game of Thrones TV show, about battles/kings. The program also includes an opt-in function where the user can receive a confirmation email if the email is provided and the checkbox is selected

The basic layout of the code is: 1) imports 2) configuring the master window 3) defining error handling functions for later use 4) defining the buttons 5) formatting the layout of the window.
Typcially, this file would then be compiled by pyinstaller and distributed to users, however, the .exe file was unable to be laoded into GitHub due to the size.
